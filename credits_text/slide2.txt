Heartfelt thanks to all Poolers, Mappers and Playtesters who put in blood,
sweat and tears to realize this (almost) year-long mapping project, and
all Referees, Commentators and Streamers who put all their soul and time
into overseeing the smooth running of this tournament. None of this
is possible without the efforts from everyone.
                       
Special Thanks to Supa7onyz and HowToPlayLN for their amazing
custom songs. All credit is due to composers where they deserve it <3
                       
Last but not least, thank you for playing (the maps of) o!mLN3!
